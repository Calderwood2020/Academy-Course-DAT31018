## Course objectives

* We learn the concept and techniques of Exploratory Data Analysis
* Touch upon the issue of bias and how to mitigate it
* Learn about more advanced formats such as HDF
* Learn basic exploratory data analysis using pandas
* Create standard graphs using seaborn
* Calculate Contingency tables, WoE and Information Value using pandas, scipy and statsmodels

The course is live at the [Open Risk Academy](https://www.openriskacademy.com), this repository
hosts the python scripts used in the course. The scripts can be used standalone but documentation 
is minimal

## Brief Description 

* Step 1: Importing data using pandas
* Step 2: Blindfoldind data and saving in HDF format to preserve metadata
* Step 3: Univariate statistics for numerical and categorical variables
* Step 4: Histograms and Barplots using Seaborn
* Step 5: Identifying outliers visually and numerically
* Step 6: Scatterplots, correlations and correlations heatmaps
* Step 7: Contingency tables and mosaic plots
* Step 8: Assessing association using Chi-Square tests and Information Value
